\title{
  Concatenate waypoints
}
\description{
Concatenates waypoints to a list and extracts and combines their projection field to a toplevel projection field.
The returned list's class is "sl.waypoints".
}
\usage{
sl.trackingshot.waypoints(projection, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{projection}{
    String containing the desired projection to do an equality check with given waypoints.
}
  \item{\dots}{
    lists of class "sl.waypoint" to be concatenated.
}
