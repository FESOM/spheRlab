# spheRlab README file

spheRlab is an R package with numerous functions related to spherical geometry. The package is intended in particular for analysis and plotting of geophysical unstructured-grid data, for example data produced by the Finite Element (or volumE) Sea-ice Ocean Model (FESOM).

The original development of spheRlab has been driven by personal technical needs to be addressed while working with unstructured-grid data in the context of climate model development and research. The package content is in particular shaped by data produced by the Finite Element (or volumE) Sea-ice Ocean Model (FESOM) of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), and a combined usage with the Climate Data Operators (CDO).

The further development of spheRlab is hoped to get some boost by the move of the project to GitHub for public collaborative code sharing and development.

Starting with version 1.0.0 on 8 December 2016, the code is known to be rich in bugs and needs for improvements. Any help and other feedback is greatly appreciated, either directly on GitHub or via email to <helge.goessling@awi.de>!

What follows is a list of what needs and/or could be done to improve spheRlab:

## URGENT

* Write two vignettes (based on rmarkdown and probably packagedocs; http://hafen.github.io/packagedocs/): 1) General spheRlab documentation, 2) Using spheRlab for FESOM

* Add function that downloads FESOM meshes and example data from GitHub; default shall be the pi-grid at GitHub FESOM-data.

* Add examples for (almost) every function; for functions involving unstructured meshes, use the pi-grid.

## NEXT

* Finish sl.polygon.polygon.intersect and sl.polygon.rotdir (or omit?).

* Update sl.plot.polygon to handle polygons truncated into multiple visible parts also in polar and regpoly projections.

* Implement horizontal colourbars.

* Add other projections (robin, mercator, other?).

* Add function that writes filter information into a CDO-readable file (see corresponding script).

* Group function index: plotting; spherical geometry; mostly internal functions; â€¦

* Add a function sl.plot.3D.end.

## WISHLIST

* Split sl.readFESOM into a more basic read function and multiple grid analysis functions.

* Add grid generation capabilities.

* Maybe introduce objects (S3 or S4?)? -> grid; colourbar (with breaks?); plot specifics list; more?

* More argument testing at beginning of functions.

* Generalise sl.trackingshot (see note 2 in the corresponding documentation)

* Speed up things where possible.

* Move into 3D-field plotting and analysis; includes handling sections.
